  # @todo #309:30min Run Etcd in windows containers while testing on windows.
  #  Currently, when we try to run integration tests based on testcontainers within a platform
  #  windows, we notice that Etcd container (presently based on Linux) can't work. We have to build
  #  and publish an Etcd docker image based on windows to avoid this issue.
  #  Please, build an Etcd image for windows (version 3.5.1) and write tests so as to detect before
  #  running integration tests, the type of platform (linux or windows) in order to pull the right
  #  docker image. After that, replace run script above only by {@code mvn clean verify -B -Pqulice}.
